# Database!

**What is a Database?**

A _database_ is a set of data stored in a computer. This data is usually structured in a way that makes the data easily accessible.

**What is a Relational Database?**

A _relational database_ is a type of database. It uses a structure that allows us to identify and access data _in relation_ to another piece of data in the database. Often, data in a relational database is organized into tables.

**Tables: Rows and Columns**

Tables can have hundreds, thousands, sometimes even millions of rows of data. These rows are often called _records_.

Tables can also have many _columns_ of data. Columns are labeled with a descriptive name \(say, age for example\) and have a specific _data type_.

**What is a Relational Database Management System \(RDBMS\)?**

A relational database management system \(RDBMS\) is a program that allows you to create, update, and administer a relational database. Most relational database management systems use the SQL language to access the database.

**What is SQL?**

SQL \(**S**tructured **Q**uery **L**anguage\) is a programming language used to communicate with data stored in a relational database management system.

**Popular Relational Database Management Systems**

SQL syntax may differ slightly depending on which RDBMS you are using. Here is a brief description of popular RDBMSs: [**MySQL**](https://www.mysql.com/)**,**[**PostgreSQL**](https://www.postgresql.org/)**,**[**Oracle DB**](https://www.oracle.com/database/) **and** [**SQLite**](https://www.sqlite.org/) _\*\*_
